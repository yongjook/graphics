---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to 15-462!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here you will find instructions for building the project and a
short description of each source file.

There is quite a bit of starter code for project 1. It contains math
utility functions and classes, code to load the application, code to load
models, and code to handle mouse/keyboard input.

Report any bugs to the TAs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the Code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses the CMake build system (www.cmake.org). CMake is a kind of
"meta build-system," in that it creates a build system for you. It supports
many different build systems, ranging from Unix Makefiles to Visual Studio
projects to XCode projects.

1) If you don't have CMake installed, you should install it. If you're running
    Linux, it should be available through your disto's package manager
    (apt-get, pacman, ports, etc). Windows and OSX installers can be downloaded
    from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
2) Open up a command prompt in the "build" directory and run "cmake ../src".
    CMake will generate the build system in the build directory. By default,
    CMake will generate Makefiles on Linux and OSX and a Visual Studio project
    on Windows. If you'd like to change that, you can pass a different
    "generator" to cmake with the -G flag. A full list of generators can be
    found at the bottom of the output generated by running "cmake". For
    example, "cmake -G 'Xcode' ../src" will generate an Xcode project on OSX.
3) You can now use the build system in the "build" directory. The default
    target will compile everything for you, and the "install" target will copy
    the p2 executable to the main "p2" directory.

WINDOWS NOTE: If you're using Windows, you'll have to add the "windows/bin"
directory to your PATH environment variable so Windows can find the shared
libraries the project will use.

Note: Your program MUST COMPILE on the SCS Linux machines. If you use
Windows, make sure to test on Linux well in advance of the deadline.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the Program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: p1

Instructions:

    Use the mouse and 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', and 'e' to move the
    camera around. The keys translate the camera, and left and right
    mouse buttons rotate the camera.

    Press 'f' to take a screenshot of the current frame buffer. It is
    written to a file whose name is based on the current system time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the sake of simpler math routines and data structures, the code uses
C++ over straight C. The code tries to stay away from most features of the
language to keep it as simple as possible. This project attempts to break
you into C++ easily.

Questions about virtual functions, classes, or any C++ idioms are welcome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Files and Directory Structure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code base is rather big, so here's a description of the top-level
directories and every header/source file pair we give you. You are free
to edit any of them and add as many as you like, as long as the program
behavior remains the same.

Note: we omit the '.cpp' or '.hpp' from the source file names.

You'll probably want to start by looking at project.hpp and all the
headers in the math/ folder.
