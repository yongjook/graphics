ummm. yeah project 2.. i messed up. 

I didn't count the times i will be out of campus for interivews and i started only a week and realized that there was wayyy more things to read and understand.
I'm sorry. I hate myself too and my data structure which is none existance.
BUT I got shader to work!! and it looks dope. 


So i will now begin to explain what i have done. what little i have done. Professor said that she would take account 2 days that i was without the 5xxx computers which meant that i 
could not compile or run any of my codes. 


1. I have implemented a enviromental map shader by utilizing the red book. I used reflect function and texture function to acquire the texture of the cubemap and set that as the gl_FragColor. 

2. To test the shader. i suggest you take out the whole subdivide code and run it. It will look glrious. 

3. now to explain my structure. i go through each triangle and get its index and positions then i get the vectorD to put find the odd vertices
then i put those odd vectices into the even vertice list. I then make a list of adjacent vertices for each of the vertex to use it in the beta formula to find the even vertices and to update the position. 


To my dismay, this is only a theory. I did not have enough time to work on the syntax or to debug, and i dont' want to use late days when i have 3 project left. 

sorry for a bad project.
